    *  Objective: Given an amount of cents, break it into Quarters, Dimes, Nickels and pennies.
    *  Add these coins to your wallet, and return the wallet holding these coins.
    *
    *  Hints:
    *       - The wallet has functions to add the coins: addQuarter(), addNickel(), addDime() and addPenny()
    *       - In this lab you'll have to use the modulo operator (%) Google it, but basically it works likes a
    *         division remainder calculator.  For example, 45 % 4 would be 1, because 45/4 = 11 with a remainder of 1
    *       - You'll probably want to use a while() loop here (or several).  Google what that is as well.
